Yelp
====

This week we have been replicating aspects of Yelp in order to become familiar with the Ruby on Rails MVC web application framework.  We have followed test-driven-development design principles using RSpec for unit tests & Capybara for feature/acceptance tests.  We have been introduced to the Devise GEM and used OmniAuth with Facebook to take advantage of third-party authentication services.  We are using a PostgreSQL database in order to be compatible with Heroku.
